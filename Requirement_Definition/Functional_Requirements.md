# Functional Requirements

Functional requirements specify the behaviors and functionalities that the AI system must have to meet the needs defined in the user stories. These requirements describe what the system should do.

## Functional Requirement Template

A functional requirement typically includes the following components:
- **ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement.
- **Description:** A clear and concise description of the functionality.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Conditions that must be met for the requirement to be considered complete.

### Template Example
```
**ID:** FR-01

**Description:** The system shall provide personalized product recommendations to users based on their browsing history and purchase behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The recommendations should be updated in real-time as the user interacts with the website.
- The system should display at least five relevant product recommendations on the homepage.
```

   **Description:** The system shall analyze sensor data to predict potential machinery failures and send alerts to the maintenance team.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - The system should send alerts at least 24 hours before a predicted failure.
   - The alerts should include details about the predicted failure and recommended actions.
   ```

## Prompts for Functional Requirements

To help you define clear and actionable functional requirements, here are some prompts you can use:

1. **What should the system do?**
   - What specific actions or tasks should the system perform?
   - What behaviors are expected from the system?

2. **What are the inputs and outputs?**
   - What inputs will the system receive?
   - What outputs or results should the system produce?

3. **What are the conditions for success?**
   - What criteria must be met for the requirement to be considered complete?
   - How will you measure the success of the functionality?

### Example Prompts

- **For an AI-Powered Chatbot:**
  ```
  **ID:** FR-[unique ID]

  **Description:** The chatbot shall understand and respond to user queries about order status.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The chatbot should retrieve the order status from the database within 2 seconds.
  - The response should include the current status, estimated delivery time, and any delays.
  ```
