# Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements specify the qualities and constraints of the AI system, such as performance, security, usability, and reliability. These requirements define how the system should behave and perform, rather than what it should do.

## Non-Functional Requirement Template

A non-functional requirement typically includes the following components:
- **ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement.
- **Description:** A clear and concise description of the quality or constraint.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Conditions that must be met for the requirement to be considered complete.

### Template Example
```
**ID:** NFR-01

**Description:** The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds to ensure a smooth user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The response time should be consistently measured under standard operating conditions.
- The system should meet the response time requirement for at least 95% of user queries.
```

## Sample Non-Functional Requirements

Here are some sample non-functional requirements to guide you:

1. **Performance**
   ```
   **ID:** NFR-01

   **Description:** The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds to ensure a smooth user experience.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - The response time should be consistently measured under standard operating conditions.
   - The system should meet the response time requirement for at least 95% of user queries.
   ```

2. **Security**
   ```
   **ID:** NFR-02

   **Description:** The system shall encrypt all user data in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Data encryption should use AES-256 or higher.
   - Regular security audits should be conducted to ensure compliance.
   ```

3. **Usability**
   ```
   **ID:** NFR-03

   **Description:** The system shall have an intuitive and user-friendly interface to ensure ease of use for all users.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Usability testing should result in a satisfaction score of at least 4 out of 5.
   - All major functionalities should be accessible within three clicks.
   ```

4. **Reliability**
   ```
   **ID:** NFR-04

   **Description:** The system shall achieve an uptime of 99.9% to ensure high availability.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Downtime should not exceed 8.76 hours per year.
   - The system should have automated failover mechanisms in place.
   ```

## Prompts for Non-Functional Requirements

To help you define clear and actionable non-functional requirements, here are some prompts you can use:

1. **What are the performance expectations?**
   - What response times are acceptable?
   - What throughput or processing capacity is required?

2. **What are the security requirements?**
   - How should data be protected?
   - What compliance standards must be met?

3. **What are the usability criteria?**
   - How should the user interface be designed?
   - What usability metrics should be achieved?

4. **What are the reliability standards?**
   - What level of system availability is required?
   - What measures should be in place to handle failures?

### Example Prompts

- **For an AI-Powered Chatbot:**
  ```
  **ID:** NFR-[unique ID]

  **Description:** The chatbot shall maintain a response time of less than 2 seconds for 95% of user queries.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Response times should be logged and analyzed on a weekly basis.
  - At least 95% of queries should meet the response time requirement.
  ```

- **For a Predictive Analytics System:**
  ```
  **ID:** NFR-[unique ID]

  **Description:** The system shall ensure that all data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Encryption should use AES-256 or higher.
  - Regular security assessments should confirm compliance with encryption standards.
  ```

## Conclusion

Non-functional requirements are essential for defining the qualities and constraints of the AI system. By following the template and utilizing the prompts, you can create clear and actionable non-functional requirements that ensure the system meets performance, security, usability, and reliability standards.
