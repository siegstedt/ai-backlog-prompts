# Introduction

Welcome to the AI Requirements Prompts repository! This document serves as an introduction to the repository, its purpose, and how non-technical users can make the most out of the provided resources.

## Overview

The main goal of this repository is to assist non-technical users in translating their ideas for AI-powered solutions into detailed system requirements that can be easily understood and implemented by technical teams. Effective requirements engineering is crucial for the success of any AI project, and this repository aims to bridge the gap between conceptual ideas and technical specifications.

## Guide for Non-Technical Users

If you are new to requirements engineering or AI concepts, don't worry! This guide will help you navigate through the repository and utilize the prompts and templates effectively.

1. **Start with User Stories:** Focus on what the end-users need from the system. Use the provided templates and prompts to create user stories that capture these needs.

2. **Define Functional Requirements:** Based on the user stories, specify the behaviors and functionalities the system must have. Use the functional requirement templates and prompts to articulate these requirements clearly.

3. **Specify Non-Functional Requirements:** Detail the qualities and constraints of the system, such as performance, security, and usability. The non-functional requirement templates and prompts will guide you through this process.

4. **Organize and Manage Your Backlog:** Compile all your requirements into a backlog document. Use the backlog management section to prioritize and refine your requirements.

## Example Scenarios

To help you get started, here are a few example scenarios illustrating how the prompts can be applied:

### Scenario 1: Customer Support Chatbot

Imagine you want to develop an AI-powered chatbot for customer support. Hereâ€™s how you can use the prompts:

- **User Stories:** "As a customer, I want to get quick answers to my questions so that I don't have to wait on hold."
  
- **Functional Requirements:** "The chatbot should be able to understand and respond to frequently asked questions related to our products and services."

- **Non-Functional Requirements:** "The chatbot should respond to user queries within 2 seconds to ensure a smooth user experience."

### Scenario 2: Predictive Maintenance System

Consider a predictive maintenance system for industrial machinery:

- **User Stories:** "As a maintenance manager, I want to be alerted before a machine fails so that I can schedule maintenance and avoid downtime."
  
- **Functional Requirements:** "The system should analyze sensor data to predict potential failures and send alerts to the maintenance team."

- **Non-Functional Requirements:** "The system should have an accuracy rate of at least 95% in predicting failures to minimize false alarms."

## Conclusion

This repository is designed to be a practical resource for anyone looking to define clear and actionable requirements for AI projects. By following the prompts and templates, you can ensure that your ideas are effectively communicated to technical teams, leading to successful AI implementations.

Happy prompting!
